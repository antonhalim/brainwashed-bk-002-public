## Background 

> I want to share a book with you that made a dramatic impact on my life when I read it 5 years ago. In a lot of ways, the Flatiron School has at its core many of the ideas presented in this book. 
> -Blake Johnson

The book is called [Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591844096) by [Seth Godin](https://twitter.com/thisissethsblog). You will be reading a PDF summary of the book and watching an optional video.

Keep reading:

> Our motto, “not a little better”, reflects our belief that we want to embody greatness in everything we do. We want our students to be not just a little better, but massively better.
>
> We’ve had 3 students present at RailsConf last year all having been programming for less than a year.  This year we have 3 students presenting at RubyConf.  Our students have spoken at conferences all around the world. We’ll soon have students working at every company in New York.  All of them at one point sat where you sit today, and challenged the resistance that holds us back from being remarkable.
> 
> Are you going to go through this program, and your life just doing the minimum?  What would your life be like if you set your sights 10 times higher than what you expect of yourself today?
>
> Linchpin asks, are you indispensable? What does it take to have a remarkable life?

## PDF

It’s infeasible to have you all read the whole book but the PDF is a summary of the ideas in the book. You are strongly encouraged read the book once the semester is over.

Read the PDF summary [here](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/docs/brainwash.pdf).

## Video

You are encouraged to watch the video below although it’s not required.  Godin tells great anecdotes and adds some context in person which you'll miss if you only read the PDF.

## Instructions - Pt. 1

Write a blog post reflecting on the content and questions below:

* What does Seth mean by the title brainwashed? Are you brainwashed?
* What is the function of public education?
* What is art?
* Is that act of coming here your art?  Or are you looking for us to draw you a map? 
* Why are you here?
* What is the resistance?
* What does failure mean? How is failure at Flatiron different than what you are used to?

When you are finished writing, remember to proof-read for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors and add your post to `lib/blog_post.txt`. Save, then run your testing suite and make sure it passes. Finally, add, commit, and submit a pull request, just as you would a typical lab.

## Instructions - Pt. 2

On Tuesday morning, take a look at a fellow student's pull request. Read what they wrote for this assignment and respond to it by making a comment on their pull request.

Should you notice any spelling, grammatical, or structure errors, let them know as well, though this should be treated as more of an afterthought than the focus of your comment.

* What does Seth mean by the title brainwashed? Are you brainwashed?
	It is the system that we are living in where it shapes us into a compliant workers,
	instruction followers, and a straight common uniformed people.
	I  believe everyone who is living in this country is being brainwashed by the system, and
	I am not an exception. It's so much easier and less scary to be followers instead of
	being a leader and start something new. We are all brainwashed by our sytem to be
	one of the common, brainwashed to be set limit to our ability, brainwashed to follow
	and be part of role in the society.

* What is the function of public education?
	Public education was a place for any of us to be educated and get a job through it.
	It was so popular that it was regulated in the system and was set as an standard of expectation
	for anyone to be the part of the society. For example, getting a job and being aknowledge by people.
	Hence, public education for me is a place where everyone should go and learn the basic
	knowledge, skill. Where you don't really have to be the best at it, but good enough for you
	to have basic idea and ability to play role in society.
	However, it is overused by our system to determine the quality of a person, and sadly
	most of the time is quality of the person just as a worker.

* What is art?
	Art is human ability, in any sort kind of sense, where anyone who sees it genuine, different,
	and it doesn't limit just to any artistic material that we produce on a media should be called an art.
	Here some example of art in my perspective : an idea itself is an art, slang word
	is and art, and inventions that change the way we think of possiblity.
===============================================================================================

* Is that act of coming here your art?  Or are you looking for us to draw you a map?
	I notice there is art involved where, we take the risky path now, abandoning
	the regulated education system and believe that whatever we learn and become later on
	will have value in society and set a new point of view as education is not just
	knowledge being taught at common school..

* Why are you here?
	I think of me being in Flatiron school is to learn how does the convention pattern works,
	where for me its to be able to put myself in a better role in society, as a developer, for example.

* What is the resistance?
	The voice inside our head that hold us from doing things based on our authenticity.
	The stance of human nature resist us from what we want, and instead make us changing our decision because it tell us to.
	Somewhat often, it makes us live in fear of it.
===============================================================================================

* What does failure mean? How is failure at Flatiron different than what you are used to?
	I start seeing failure differently, I used to be stressed and freaked out when failure comes.
	Flatiron teach me to see failure in different perspective. Failure is part of learning,
	without  failure, nobody learns. And it is really OK to fail, as long as you acknowledge the failure,
	overcome the problem, realize and avoid it if it ever happens again.
